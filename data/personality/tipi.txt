Abstract

When time is limited, researchers may be faced with the choice of using an extremely brief
measure of the Big-Five personality dimensions or using no measure at all. To meet the need
for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although
somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels
in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer re-
ports, (b) test–retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) conver-
gence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of
the Big-Five dimensions is oﬀered for situations where very short measures are needed, person-
ality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished
psychometric properties associated with very brief measures.

1. Introduction

One obvious way to learn about an individualÕs standing on a personality trait is
simply to enquire directly about that trait. For constructs, such as Extraversion, that
are widely understood, it is more straightforward simply to ask a person how extra-
verted he is than to ask him whether he enjoys the company of others, attends parties
frequently, is talkative, outgoing, gregarious, and enthusiastic. That is, why not ask a

person one direct question about a trait rather than many questions about the multi-
ple, narrow components that comprise the trait?

The widely accepted answer is that, all things being equal, long instruments tend
to have better psychometric properties than short instruments. However, the costs
associated with short instruments are not always as great as is feared (Burisch,
1984a, 1984b, 1997). More important, there are some instances when short instru-
ments permit research that would not be possible using long instruments.

1.1. Why are short instruments needed?

In an ideal world, personality researchers would have suﬃcient time and resources
to exploit the superior content validity and reliability of well-established multi-item
instruments. Unfortunately, circumstances are often not ideal and researchers may
be faced with a stark choice of using an extremely brief instrument or using no in-
strument at all. For example, one Internet-based study used a single-item measure
to obtain ratings of self-esteem from participants who would be unlikely to dwell
at the website long enough to complete a multi-item questionnaire (Robins, Trzes-
niewski, Tracy, Gosling, & Potter, 2002). Studies that require participants to rate
themselves and multiple others on several occasions may also proﬁt from the use
of short scales. In one longitudinal study of interpersonal perceptions, participants
were required to rate several other group members on several traits on several occa-
sions (Paulhus & Bruce, 1992); multi-item scales would have burdened participants
excessively so single-item measures were used. Other useful applications for short in-
struments include large-scale surveys, pre-screening packets, longitudinal studies,
and experience-sampling studies (Robins, Hendin, & Trzesniewski, 2001a).

Although single-item scales are usually psychometrically inferior to multiple-item
scales, single-item measures do have some advantages. In developing a single-item
measure of self-esteem, Robins et al. (2001a) noted that single-item measures
‘‘. . .eliminate item redundancy and therefore reduce the fatigue, frustration, and
boredom associated with answering highly similar questions repeatedly’’ (p. 152; also
see Saucier, 1994). Indeed, Burisch (1984b, 1997) showed that short and simple de-
pression scales can be just as valid as long and sophisticated scales. For example, self
and peer reports converged just as strongly for a truncated 9-item depression scale
(r ¼ :54) as for the full 50-item scale (r ¼ :51). BurischÕs ﬁndings suggest that the
supposed psychometric superiority of longer scales does not always translate into
practice. If the psychometric costs of using short scales are not as steep as might
be expected, their relative eﬃciency make them a very attractive research tool. The
widespread use of single-item measures is a testimony to their appeal. Single-item
measures have been used to assess such constructs as life-satisfaction (Campbell,
Converse, & Rodgers, 1976), subjective well-being (Diener, 1984; Sandvik, Diener,
& Seidlitz, 1993), aﬀect (Russell, Weiss, & Mendelsohn, 1989), cultural/ethnic iden-
tity (Benet-Martıınez, Leu, Lee, & Morris, 2002), relationship intimacy (Aron, Aron,
& Danny, 1992), attachment style (Hazan & Shaver, 1987), intelligence (Paulhus,
Lysy, & Yik, 1998), and self-esteem (Robins, Tracy, Trzesniewski, Potter, & Gosling,
2001b).

1.2. Previous Big-Five instruments

In this report, we evaluate new 5 and 10-item measures of the Big-Five personality
dimensions. The Big-Five framework enjoys considerable support and has become
the most widely used and extensively researched model of personality (for reviews,
see John & Srivastava, 1999, and McCrae & Costa, 1999), although it has not been
accepted universally (Block, 1995).

The Big-Five framework is a hierarchical model of personality traits with ﬁve
broad factors, which represent personality at the broadest level of abstraction. Each
bipolar factor (e.g., Extraversion vs. Introversion) summarizes several more speciﬁc
facets (e.g., Sociability), which, in turn, subsume a large number of even more spe-
ciﬁc traits (e.g., talkative, outgoing). The Big-Five framework suggests that most in-
dividual diﬀerences in human personality can be classiﬁed into ﬁve broad,
empirically derived domains.

Several rating instruments have been developed to measure the Big-Five dimen-
sions. The most comprehensive instrument is Costa and McCraeÕs (1992) 240-item
NEO Personality Inventory, Revised (NEO-PI-R), which permits measurement of
the Big-Five domains and six speciﬁc facets within each dimension. Taking about
45 min to complete, the NEO-PI-R is too lengthy for many research purposes and
so a number of shorter instruments are commonly used. Three well-established
and widely used instruments are the 44-item Big-Five Inventory (BFI; see Benet-
Martıınez & John, 1998; John & Srivastava, 1999), the 60-item NEO Five-Factor In-
ventory (NEO-FFI; Costa & McCrae, 1992), and GoldbergÕs instrument comprised
of 100 trait descriptive adjectives (TDA; Goldberg, 1992). John and Srivastava
(1999) have estimated that the BFI, NEO-FFI, and TDA take approximately 5,
15, and 15 min to complete, respectively. Recognizing the need for an even briefer
measure of the Big Five, Saucier (1994) developed a 40-item instrument derived from
GoldbergÕs (1992) 100-item set.

1.3. Overview of present research

In two studies, we evaluate new 5 and 10-item measures of the Big Five in terms of
convergence with an established Big-Five instrument (the BFI), test–retest reliability,
and patterns of predicted external correlates. In Study 1, two samples were assessed
using both the new ﬁve-item instrument and the BFI. Convergent and discriminant
validity was examined in a sample of 1704 undergraduate students who were assessed
using both instruments. To compare the pattern of external correlates of the 5-item
instrument with the pattern of external correlates of the BFI, we also administered a
battery of other instruments. To assess the test–retest reliability of the 5-item instru-
ment and of the BFI, a subset of 118 participants were assessed again two weeks
after the initial assessment. To evaluate the performance of the measure when
used in observer-report format, a second subset of 60 participants were rated by
observers after a brief getting acquainted exercise. To examine the measure when
used in peer-report format, we also collected peer reports from a new sample of
83 participants.

In Study 2, one sample was assessed using both the 10-item instrument and the
BFI. Convergent and discriminant validity was examined in a sample of 1813 under-
graduate students who were assessed using both instruments. To compare the pat-
tern of external correlates of the 10-item instrument with those of the BFI, a
battery of other instruments was also administered. To evaluate the foci of the scales
from the BFI and the 10-item instrument, we also administered the NEO-PI-R to a
subset of 180 participants. To assess the test–retest reliability of the 10-item instru-
ment, the same subset of participants were assessed again, six weeks after the initial
assessment.

2. Study 1

The aim of Study 1 was to examine a new 5-item instrument designed to assess the
Big-Five personality dimensions. We used four tests to evaluate the instrument, each
time comparing the 5-item instrument to the BFI. First, to assess convergent and dis-
criminant validity, we obtained self-ratings, observer ratings, and peer ratings using
the 5-item instrument and the BFI.

Second, to assess test–retest reliability, a sub-sample of participants took the re-
vised 5-item instrument and the BFI a second time, two weeks after the ﬁrst test ad-
ministration. Test–retest correlations are particularly valuable for single-item
measures because internal-consistency indices of reliability cannot be computed.

Third, to examine patterns of external correlates, we also obtained self-ratings on
several other measures. The construct validity of an instrument can be deﬁned in
terms of a nomological network (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955); that is, the degree to
which a construct shows theoretically predicted patterns of correlations with other
related and unrelated constructs. Our goal here was not to validate the Big-Five con-
structs but to evaluate the degree to which a very brief measure of the Big-Five con-
structs assesses the same constructs as those assessed by a longer, established
measure. Therefore, the predicted nomological network for the 5-item instrument
was provided by the pattern of correlations shown by the standard BFI to a broad
range of constructs.

Fourth, to evaluate the convergence between self and observer reports, a sub-sam-
ple of participants were rated by observers after a brief getting acquainted exercise.
(These data were also used to examine convergent and discriminant correlations in
observer reports.)

2.1. Method

2.1.1. Instruments

One approach to constructing short tests is to select the best performing items
from longer tests on the basis of psychometric criteria, such as item-total correla-
tions. For example, to create an abbreviated set of Big-Five markers from Gold-
bergÕs 100-item set, Saucier (1994) relied on psychometric criteria, selecting those
items that showed high factor purity and would form reliable scales. The strategy

508

adopted here was diﬀerent. Instead of psychometric criteria, we focused on optimiz-
ing the content validity of our short measure—we aimed to enhance the bandwidth
of the items by including in each item several descriptors selected to capture the
breadth of the Big-Five dimensions. Thus, we used a strategy akin to the one used
by Hazan and Shaver (1987) who created paragraph-long items that clearly de-
scribed the heart and breadth of the attachment-style constructs they were assessing.
To create items, John and Srivastava (1999) have recommended adding elaborative,
clarifying, or contextual information to one or two prototypical adjectives. John and
Srivastava (1999) note that augmented items retain the advantages of brevity and
simplicity associated with single adjectives, while avoiding some of their pitfalls, such
as ambiguous or multiple meanings.

Thus, we consensually selected descriptors to represent each of the domains.
Where possible, we culled descriptors from existing Big-Five instruments, drawing
most heavily on GoldbergÕs (1992) list of unipolar and bipolar Big-Five markers, ad-
jectives from the BFI, and John and SrivastavaÕs (1999) Adjective Checklist Big-Five
markers.1 Selection was based on the following ﬁve guidelines. First, we strove
for breadth of coverage, using the facets of the Big Five to guide our selections. Sec-
ond, we identiﬁed items representing both poles of each dimension. Third, where
possible we selected items that were not evaluatively extreme. Fourth, for the sake
of clarity, we avoided using items that were simply negations. Fifth, we attempted
to minimize redundancy among the descriptors. We developed a standard format,
in which each item was deﬁned by two central descriptors and clariﬁed by six other
descriptors, that together covered the breadth of each domain and included items
from the high and low poles. The resulting ﬁve items were: Extraverted, enthusiastic
(that is, sociable, assertive, talkative, active, NOT reserved, or shy); Agreeable, kind
(that is, trusting, generous, sympathetic, cooperative, NOT aggressive, or cold); De-
pendable, organized (that is, hard working, responsible, self-disciplined, thorough,
NOT careless, or impulsive); Emotionally stable, calm (that is, relaxed, self-conﬁ-
dent, NOT anxious, moody, easily upset, or easily stressed); Open to experience,
imaginative (that is, curious, reﬂective, creative, deep, open-minded, NOT conven-
tional). Each of the ﬁve items was rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (disagree
strongly) to 7 (agree strongly).

Participants also completed the 44-item BFI (John & Srivastava, 1999). The BFI
shows high convergent validity with other self-report scales and with peer ratings of

1 In a pilot study, we used single-item scales based on the labels commonly used to refer to the Big Five
dimensions: ‘‘Extraverted,’’ ‘‘Agreeable, warm,’’ ‘‘Conscientious,’’ ‘‘Emotionally stable,’’ and ‘‘Open to
new experiences.’’ The major ﬁnding to emerge from this study was that ‘‘conscientious’’ was hard for lay
judges to interpret; convergent correlations between ratings on the ‘‘conscientious’’ item and the BFI
conscientiousness scale were only .22 for self reports and .36 for peer reports (compared to .81 and .76, .64
and .72, .65 and .70, and .55 and .51, respectively, for Extraversion, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability
and Openness). However, when judges who were familiar with the Big Five used the item, the convergent
correlations rose dramatically—the convergent correlation between peer ratings by experts on the
‘‘conscientious’’ item and the BFI conscientiousness was .81. The lesson to emerge from these pilot data
was that the Big Five deﬁnitions are not conveyed to laypersons by the common Big Five labels, and that
care should be taken to select items familiar to laypersons.

the Big Five. The BFI items were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (disagree
strongly) to 5 (agree strongly).

To permit us to examine a broad array of external correlates of the new Five Item
Personality Inventory (FIPI) and the BFI, participants also completed a battery of
other measures: the Brief Loquaciousness and Interpersonal Responsiveness Test
(BLIRT; Swann & Rentfrow, 2001), the Social Dominance Orientation question-
naire (SDO; Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, 1994), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Scale (RSES; Rosenberg, 1965), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, 1972),
the Math Identiﬁcation Questionnaire (MIQ; Brown & Josephs, 1999), the Short
Test of Music Preferences (STOMP; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), and single-item
measures of political values, physical attractiveness, wealth, athletic ability, and
intelligence.

2.1.2. Recruitment and participants

We examined the FIPI in two samples (A1 and B) of participants, as well as two
sub-samples (Samples A2 and A3) drawn from sample A1. Sample A1 was com-
prised of 1704 University of Texas at Austin undergraduates who volunteered in ex-
change for partial fulﬁllment of an introductory psychology course requirement.
Participants completed the battery of instruments described above. To reduce the
carryover from the FIPI to the BFI, we separated them with several other instru-
ments. Of those who indicated, 1058 (62.6%) were women, 633 (37.4%) were men,
205 (13.5%) were Asian, 205 (13.5%) were Hispanic, 988 (65%) were White, and
122 (8%) were of other ethnicities.

Two weeks later, a sub-sample of 118 of the participants (sample A2) were tested
again. In exchange for partial fulﬁllment of an introductory psychology course re-
quirement, participants completed a second battery of questionnaires, including
the FIPI and the BFI. Of those who indicated, 94 (81.7%) were women and
21(18.3%) were men, 25 (21.9%) were Asian, 11 (9.6%) were Hispanic, 64 (56.2%)
were White, and 14 (12.3%) were of other ethnicities.

Between 2 and 9 weeks later, another sub-sample of 60 participants (sample A3)
returned to the lab in previously unacquainted same sex pairs.2 In exchange for par-
tial fulﬁllment of an introductory psychology course requirement, each pair of par-
ticipants took part in a zero-acquaintance type exercise in which they had 15 min to
introduce themselves and learn a little about one another. After just 15-min, each
participant rated the other participant using peer-report versions of the FIPI and
the BFI. Of those who indicated, 27 (45.8%) were women and 32 (54.2%) were
men, 7 (11.9%) were Asian, 8 (13.6%) were Hispanic, 32 (54.2%) were White, and
12 (20.3%) were of other ethnicities.

Sample B was comprised of 83 University of Texas undergraduates who volun-
teered in exchange for partial fulﬁllment of an introductory psychology course re-
quirement. Participants completed a second battery of questionnaires, including
peer-report versions of the FIPI and the BFI, which they used to describe ‘‘a person

you know well.’’ Thus, the participants in this study were raters, not targets. Of those
who indicated, 26 (49.1%) were women and 27 (50.9%) were men, 9 (17.3%) were
Asian, 7 (13.5%) were Hispanic, 34 (65.4%) were White, and 2 (3.8%) were of other
ethnicities.

2.2. Results and discussion

2.2.1. Convergence across measures

In samples A1, A2, A3, and B, we correlated the BFI scale scores with the FIPI
scores. The convergent correlations in sample A1 between the BFI and FIPI are
shown in the diagonal of Table 1; these convergent correlations (mean r ¼ :65) far
exceeded the oﬀ-diagonal correlations (absolute mean r ¼ :18), none of which ex-
ceeded .30. More important from a construct validation perspective (Campbell &
Fiske, 1959), the pattern of oﬀ-diagonal correlations is similar across both measures,
correlating .65 across the 10 possible oﬀ-diagonal discriminant correlations.

The convergent correlations and oﬀ-diagonal discriminant correlations from the
self-report data shown individually in Table 1 are summarized in column 1 of Table
2. Convergent and discriminant correlations from samples A2, A3, and B are sum-
marized in data columns 2, 3, and 4 of Table 2 respectively. The convergent corre-
lations were substantial, with the patterns of correlations holding across self
(samples A1 and A2), zero-aquaintance observer (sample A3), and peer-ratings
(sample B). As in sample A1, the convergent correlations consistently exceeded the
oﬀ-diagonal discriminant correlations.

As shown in Table 2, the discriminant correlations in both instruments were un-
usually large for the observer ratings. However, it should be borne in mind that these
ratings were made about strangers after only 15 min of getting acquainted, so
the strong discriminant correlations probably reﬂect the limited exposure to relevant
behavioral information rather than deﬁciencies of the instruments themselves.

Overall, the convergent and discriminant correlations appear promising but how
do they compare with correlations obtained using well-established multi-item in-
struments? The ﬁfth data column of Table 2 summarizes the convergent and dis-
criminant correlations obtained using the 5-item instrument tested in Study 1.
For purposes of comparison the 7th and 8th data columns in Table 2 show con-
vergent correlations (from John & Srivastava, 1999) between the BFI and two
the Big-Five dimensions3—GoldbergÕs
other standard multi-item measures of
instrument, and Costa and McCraeÕs (1992) NEO-
(1992) 100-item adjectival
FFI. Multi-item inventories tend to be more reliable than single-item inventories
so one would expect stronger correlations between the BFI and the multi-item in-
struments than between the BFI and the 5-item instrument; indeed, the conver-
gences among the multi-item inventories were stronger (rs ¼ :81 and .73) than
the convergences between the BFI and the 5-item instrument, which averaged in
the mid to high .60s.

2.2.2. Test–retest reliability

We estimated test–retest reliability for each instrument by correlating scores ob-
tained in the ﬁrst rating session with the scores obtained in a second rating session,
approximately two weeks later. As shown in the ﬁrst two data columns of Table 3,
the test–retest correlations are substantial for both the BFI and the FIPI. However,
with the exception of Extraversion, which was equivalent across instruments, the
BFI yielded test–retest correlations (mean r ¼ :80) that were .10 to .20 points stron-
ger than the FIPI (mean r ¼ :68).
2.2.3. External correlates

To test whether the patterns of external correlates of the FIPI matched the pat-
terns of external correlates of the BFI, we correlated both instruments with each
of the other constructs assessed in the testing battery. These patterns of external cor-
relates are shown separately for each of the Big-Five dimensions in Table 4. As one
would expect for such a broad array of constructs the magnitude of correlations var-
ied greatly. To test whether the patterns of correlations were similar across instru-
ments, we computed column-vector correlations for each of the ﬁve dimensions.
Specifically, we transformed the correlations using FisherÕs r-to-z formula and then
computed the correlation between the two columns of transformed correlations. As
shown by the column-vector correlations in Table 4, the FIPI displayed patterns of
correlations that were virtually identical to the BFI; column-vector correlations ran-
ged from .819 for Openness to .997 for Extraversion.4 Overall, the FIPI exhibited
patterns of correlations that matched very closely those obtained for the BFI. How-
ever, because the FIPI was less reliable than the BFI the absolute magnitude of the

3 John and Srivastava (1999) did not report the discriminant correlations for these instruments.
4 It should be noted that strong column-vector correlations could be generated merely from the
inclusion of a mixture of constructs, some of which correlate strongly and some of which correlate weakly
with the Big-Five dimensions.

correlations should be weaker. As shown in the bottom row of Table 4, the BFI con-
sistently yielded stronger correlations than the FIPI, although the magnitude of the
diﬀerence was small.

2.2.4. Convergence across self- and observer-reports

To examine the convergence between self- and observer-reports, we correlated
the self-reports with observer-reports obtained 2–9 weeks later. Recall that the ob-
server-reports were made on the basis of only a 15-min getting acquainted exercise
so we did not expect the magnitude of the correlations to be very strong. For the
purposes of evaluating the FIPI, we were primarily interested in comparing the
self-observer correlations obtained using the FIPI with those obtained using
the BFI. As shown in Table 5, the pattern of FIPI correlations generally matched
those of the BFI. However, the magnitude of the BFI correlations was stronger
than that of the FIPI correlations, especially for Extraversion, Agreeableness,
and Openness.

2.2.5. Summary

Although somewhat inferior to the standard Big-Five instrument examined here,
the FIPI reached adequate levels in each of the four criteria against which it was
evaluated: convergent and discriminant validity, test–retest reliability, patterns of ex-
ternal correlates, and convergence between self- and observer-ratings. The FIPI mea-
sure of Extraversion fared the best across the criteria and FIPI measure of Openness
fared least well. Overall our ﬁndings suggest that the FIPI instrument can stand as a
reasonable proxy for a longer Big-Five instrument, especially when research condi-
tions dictate that a very short measure be used.

2.2.6. Limitations

Despite the evidence for the value of the FIPI, single-item measures are subject to
some serious limitations. The ﬁrst limitation is the psychometric cost of using short
measures. Compared with standard multi-item measures of the Big Five, the FIPI is

less reliable, converges less strongly with other Big-Five measures, and has weaker
correlations with other variables.

The second limitation associated with the FIPI concerns its use in analyses involv-
ing latent variables, such as structural equation modeling. Such analyses estimate the
error terms with which latent variables are measured by using multiple indicators of
the same latent variable. Single-item measures provide only a single estimate of the
latent variable so error terms must be estimated by other means. For example, re-
searchers may have to estimate the error terms from test–retest correlations, such
as the ones reported in Table 3.

In addition, unlike multi-item measures, which can balance positive and negative
items, single-item measures cannot assess or control for acquiescence bias. Nor do
single items permit researchers to check for errors (e.g., from data entry) using inter-
nal consistency estimates or factor analysis.

Although the FIPI fared reasonably well compared to the BFI, there are clearly a
number of weakness associated with single-item measures. Therefore, we set out to
create a second brief measure of the Big-Five personality dimensions that avoided
the pitfalls associated with single-item scales.

3. Study 2

The goal of Study 2 was to develop and evaluate a 10-item measure of the Big-
Five personality dimensions. It was important that this new measure retain the brev-
ity of the FIPI, while diminishing the limitations associated with it. We used three
tests to evaluate the instrument, each time comparing the 10-item instrument with
the BFI. First, to assess convergent and discriminant validity, we obtained self-rat-
ings using both the 10-item instrument and the BFI. Second, to assess test–retest
reliability, a sub-sample of participants took the revised 10-item instrument a second
time, six weeks after the ﬁrst test administration. Third, to examine patterns of
external correlates, we also obtained self-ratings on several other measures.

3.1. Method

3.1.1. Instruments

The logic underlying the construction of the new 10-item questionnaire was sim-
ilar to that adopted for the FIPI. That is, we again strove to retain breadth of cov-
erage, represent both poles of each dimension, and to avoid items that were
evaluatively extreme, items that were simply negations, and redundancy among
items. With these goals in mind we created a 10-item inventory, with one item rep-
resenting each pole of the ﬁve FFM dimensions. We reduced the length and com-
plexity of the items to make them easier to understand and to allow us to double
the number of items on the inventory without increasing the time taken to complete
it. As in the construction of the FIPI, we culled descriptors from existing Big-Five
instruments, drawing most heavily on GoldbergÕs (1992) list of unipolar and bipolar
Big-Five markers, adjectives from the BFI, and John and SrivastavaÕs (1999) Adjec-
tive Checklist Big-Five markers.

The resulting Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) is reproduced in Appendix A.
Each item consists of two descriptors, separated by a comma, using the common
stem, ‘‘I see myself as:’’. Each of the ﬁve items was rated on a 7-point scale ranging
from 1 (disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly). The TIPI takes about a minute to
complete.

Many scales are designed with a goal of optimizing internal consistency. The
most widely used index of internal consistency, CronbachÕs alpha, is a function of
the mean inter-item correlation and the number of items comprising the scale. Mul-
ti-item scales can aﬀord to bolster internal consistency by using several items with
high content overlap. In constrast, with only two items per scale, the TIPI instead
emphasized content validity considerations, resulting in lower inter-item correla-
tions than is typical of more homogenous scales. The relatively low inter-item cor-
relations in conjunction with the fact that the TIPI scales have only two items
results in some unusually low internal consistency estimates. Speciﬁcally, the Cron-
bach alphas were .68, .40, .50, .73, and .45 for the Extraversion, Agreeableness,
Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Openness to Experience scales respec-
tively. Thus, these scales provide an example of how validity can exceed reliability
(as indexed by alpha). Therefore, researchers wishing to correct TIPI correlations
for unreliability should base their corrections on reliability estimates that are less
biased by our eﬀorts to retain content validity or the small number of items on each
scale; one such estimate would be the test–retest reliability correlations provided in
Table 3.

The procedures for Study 2 were similar to those for Study 1. To examine conver-
gence with an established Big-Five instrument, participants completed the 44-item
BFI (John & Srivastava, 1999). In addition, to permit us to examine the external cor-
relates of the TIPI and the BFI, participants also completed the same battery of mea-
sures included in Study 1: the BLIRT (Swann & Rentfrow, 2001), the SDO (Pratto et
al., 1994), the BDI (Beck, 1972), the MIQ (Brown & Josephs, 1999), the STOMP
(Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), and single-item measures of political values, physical
attractiveness, wealth, athletic ability, and intelligence.

3.1.2. Recruitment and participants

We examined the TIPI in one sample of participants (sample C1), as well as
one retest sample (C2). Sample C1 was comprised of 1813 University of Texas
at Austin undergraduates who volunteered in exchange for partial fulﬁllment of
an introductory psychology course requirement. Participants completed the bat-
tery of instruments described above. To reduce the carryover from the TIPI to
the BFI, we separated them with several other instruments. Of those who indi-
cated, 1173 (65%) were women and 633 (35%) were men, 333 (18.5%) were Asian,
229 (12.7%) were Hispanic, 1124 (62.3%) were White, and 117 (6.5%) were of
other ethnicities. Norms for the TIPI, derived from this sample, are presented
in Appendix B.

Six weeks later, a sub-sample of 180 of the participants (sample C2) were tested
again. In exchange for partial fulﬁllment of an introductory psychology course re-
quirement, participants completed a second battery of questionnaires, including
the TIPI and the NEO-PI-R (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Of those who indi-
cated, 121 (69.9%) were women and 52 (30.1%) were men, 30 (17.3%) were Asian,
19 (11%) were Hispanic, 110 (63.6%) were White, and 14 (8.1%) were of other
ethnicities.

3.2. Results

3.2.1. Convergence across measures

In sample C1, we correlated the BFI scale scores with the TIPI scale scores. The
convergent validities, shown in the sixth data column of Table 2 (and also along the
diagonal of Table 6), are substantial.

The oﬀ-diagonal discriminant correlations from the self-report data summarized in
column 6 of Table 2 are shown individually in Table 6. The convergent correlations

(mean r ¼ :77) far exceeded the discriminant correlations (absolute mean r ¼ :20)
and none of the discriminant correlations exceeded .36. As in Study 1, the pattern
of oﬀ-diagonal correlations is similar across both measures, correlating .55 across
the 10 possible oﬀ-diagonal discriminant correlations.

The convergent and discriminant correlations appear promising but how do
they compare with correlations obtained using well-established multi-item instru-
ments? The convergent and discriminant correlations obtained using the 10-item
instrument can be compared to the 7th and 8th data columns, which show con-
vergent correlations between the BFI and two other standard multi-item measures
of the Big-Five dimensions. Whereas the convergences between the FIPI and the
BFI (mean r ¼ :66) were somewhat smaller than the convergences between the
BFI and the other multi-item inventories (mean r ¼ :77), the TIPI displayed con-
vergences
(mean
r ¼ :77).
We next examined the correlates of the 10 individual TIPI items. Table 7
shows the correlations among the 10 TIPI items, after standard scoring the
raw data within participants to control for response biases. Table 8 shows the
correlations between the individual TIPI items and the BFI scales, and between
the individual TIPI items and composites comprised of just the positive and just
the negative BFI items.

that were comparable to the other multi-item inventories

To provide a ﬁner grained portrait of the breadth and content domains of the 10-
item measure, we examined the convergent and discriminant correlations between
the TIPI and the NEO-PI-R scale and facet scores. For purposes of comparison,
we also examined the correlations between the BFI and the NEO-PI-R. Note that
the NEO-PI-R was administered approximately 6 weeks after the BFI and TIPI.
As shown in Table 9, the convergent correlations between the TIPI and the NEO-
PI-R dimension scales were strong, ranging from .68 for Conscientiousness to .56
for Openness.

Next, we compared TIPI–NEO-PI-R correlations with the BFI–NEO-PI-R cor-
relations. As should be expected, the correlations were generally stronger between
the NEO-PI-R and the 44-item BFI than between the NEO-PI-R and the 10-item
TIPI. Nevertheless, the patterns of NEO-PI-R dimension correlations were similar
across measures. Moreover, the pattern and magnitude of the TIPI–NEO-PI-R
and BFI–NEO-PI-R facet correlations were very similar, with only a few dif-
ferences. For instance, the Openness dimension of the BFI appears to place
more emphasis on fantasy, aesthetics, and ideas than does the TIPI. Overall,
these ﬁndings provide good evidence for the construct validity of the 10-item
measure.

3.2.2. Test–retest reliability

We estimated test–retest reliability for the TIPI by correlating scores obtained in
the ﬁrst rating session with the scores obtained in a second rating session, approxi-
mately six weeks later. As shown in the third data column of Table 3, the test–retest
correlations for the TIPI are substantial (mean r ¼ :72), albeit weaker than the two-
week test–retest correlations of the BFI (mean r ¼ :80).

3.2.3. External correlates

To test whether the patterns of external correlates of the TIPI matched the pat-
terns of external correlates of the BFI, we correlated both instruments with each
of the other constructs assessed in the testing battery. These patterns of external cor-
relates are shown separately for each of the Big-Five dimensions in Table 4. As in
Study 1, we tested whether the patterns of correlations were similar across instru-
ments, by computing column-vector correlations for each of the ﬁve dimensions.
As shown by the column-vector correlations in Table 4, the TIPI displayed patterns
of correlations that were virtually identical to those of the BFI; with all column-vec-
tor correlations exceeding .90. As before, the BFI yielded correlations that were
slightly stronger than the TIPI.

4. Discussion

4.1. Summary of ﬁndings

Although somewhat inferior to the standard Big-Five instrument examined here,
the FIPI and TIPI reached adequate levels in each of the criteria against which it
was evaluated: convergent and discriminant validity, test–retest reliability, patterns
of external correlates, and (for the FIPI) convergence between self- and observer-
ratings. In both measures, Extraversion fared the best across the criteria and Open-
ness and Agreeableness fared least well. Overall our ﬁndings suggest that these very
brief instruments can stand as reasonable proxies for longer Big-Five instruments,
especially when research conditions dictate that a very short measure be used. Of
the two instruments, the 10-item instrument is psychometrically superior, it can be
used for latent variable modeling, it allows researchers to assess for acquiescence
bias and check for errors, and it takes no longer to complete than the 5-item in-
strument (about 1 min). Should a short instrument be needed, this is the one we
recommend.

4.2. Limitations

Despite the evidence for the value of the TIPI, very short measures are subject to
some serious limitations. The ﬁrst limitation is the psychometric cost of using short
measures. Compared with standard multi-item measures of the Big Five, the TIPI is
less reliable and correlates less strongly with other variables.

The second limitation of brief measures is their inability to measure individual
facets of multi-faceted constructs. The Big-Five dimensions are essentially and ex-
plicitly broad constructs encompassing several related but separable facets. Very
brief measures, such as the ones examined here, do not provide scores for the nar-
rower facet-level constructs and a much greater investment is needed to obtain
facet scores (e.g., by using the 240-item NEO-PI-R). Moreover, by using a
short instrument to measure potentially separable facets, the single-item approach

524

S.D. Gosling et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 37 (2003) 504–528

neglects the recent call to turn attention from broad factors to more speciﬁc facets,
which are often better predictors of speciﬁc criteria (Paunonen & Ashton, 2001).
However, it is worth noting that the other widely used short measures of the Big
Five (e.g., the 44-item BFI and the 60-item NEO-FFI) do not provide facet
scores either. Indeed, by using only 10 items (rather than 44 or 60) to measure
the Big Five, the TIPI may leave researchers more space and time to focus on
other measures of narrow constructs that are more directly related to their research
questions.

4.3. Beneﬁts

The central beneﬁt of the TIPI is that it extends the scope of studies in which the
Big Five can be measured. As Saucier (1994) noted in the context of his 40-item
instrument, ‘‘The availability of this extremely short set of Big-Five markers widens
the potential application of the Big Five to assessment situations where brevity is
an unusually high priority.’’ (p. 515). This beneﬁt is particularly appropriate now
that the Big-Five framework has been well established; the focus of personality re-
search is now free to shift from the psychometric and structural properties of the
Big Five to focus on relations between the Big-Five dimensions and other con-
structs and outcomes. Whereas the early structural studies needed to devote exten-
sive resources to assessing the Big Five, newer studies can aﬀord to use shorter
measures. Indeed, the development of several medium-length instruments such as
the BFI, the NEO-FFI, and SaucierÕs (1994) marker set reﬂect this change in re-
search emphasis. Although these instruments require far less time than the full
NEO-PI-R, they are still too time-consuming for some research purposes. In cases
where researchers are willing to tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric
properties associated with even briefer measures, we oﬀer the TIPI as one potential
research tool.

A second potential beneﬁt of the TIPI is that by providing a standard instrument
for use by the research community, knowledge about its psychometric properties and
its external correlates can accumulate. Without a standard instrument, researchers
would be forced to create their own measures, and could not beneﬁt from the work
done by others.

A third beneﬁt is that very brief measures eliminate item redundancy, reducing
participant boredom and the oft-expressed frustration about ‘‘answering the same
question again and again.’’ This beneﬁt can ameliorate the psychometric costs of
short measures (Burisch, 1984a, 1984b), and may explain why the TIPI performed
so well.

5. Conclusion

Harm-reduction programs such as methadone clinics and condom distribution
programs do not condone harmful behaviors but acknowledge that such behav-

S.D. Gosling et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 37 (2003) 504–528

iors exist and the programs are designed to alleviate the negative consequences
of the behaviors. Analogously, we do not encourage the use of very brief mea-
sures, but we acknowledge that when brevity is a high priority, researchers may
be driven to create their own very short measures of the Big Five or, even
worse, to use no measure at all. For such situations we provide the TIPI, for
which the psychometrics are known and are reasonable. Of course, most
harm-reduction programs run a risk of backﬁring—the possibility that the very
existence of the programs will actually increase the frequency of the behaviors
they are designed to make safer. Analogously, we hope that this instrument will
not be used in place of established multi-item instruments. Instead, we urge
that this instrument be used when time and space are in short supply and when
only an extremely brief measure of the Big Five will do. Under such circum-
stances the TIPI, which takes only a minute to complete, represents a sensible
option.

Here are a number of personality traits that may or may not apply to you.
Please write a number next to each statement to indicate the extent to which you
agree or disagree with that statement. You should rate the extent to which the pair
of traits applies to you, even if one characteristic applies more strongly than the
other.
